# mOOL-compiler
This is a project made in the course CS4212, Compiler Design at the Natinal University of Singapore. The assignments are a step-by-step development of a compiler for the java related language mOOL. Assignment 1 and 2 was made by me outputs the source code of the compiled mOOL language while Assignment 3 was a group project which consists of the finished compiler which generates ARM assembly code.

For details on how to set up the environment, please see the [report](https://github.com/novalain/mOOL-compiler/blob/master/moang-report.pdf?raw=true). After the environment has been set up, run the following shell script

```
./mta.sh -m mool_input_file 
```
to produces ARM assembly code which can then be compiled into machine code using a normal C/C++ compiler such as gcc or g++.
